What's happening in your code:
The Function Parameter (name): When you call new Toy("Teddy"), "Teddy" is passed to the function as an argument. Inside the function, name is just a local variableâ€”it only exists inside the function while it's running.

The Purpose of this: The goal of the constructor function is to create a new object (like myToy) and attach properties to it. this refers to the specific object being created when you use the new keyword.

Assigning the Name to the Object:

Without this, the name variable would only exist temporarily inside the function.
By using this.name, you're saying:
"Take the value of name and store it as a property of the object being created."

This makes the name available as part of the myToy object, so you can access it later using myToy.name.
